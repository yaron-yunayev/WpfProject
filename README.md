Important Notes
Running GAMECENTER: To access all the functionality of the project, you must run GAMECENTER. This serves as the central hub for all the sub-projects, so it is essential to run it as the main project.
Sub-Projects: There are seven sub-projects connected to GAMECENTER. Make sure they are included in the build and run processes to ensure everything functions properly.
Common Troubleshooting
Build Errors:

Ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date.
Verify that the .NET Framework version matches the project requirements.
Project Won't Run:

Ensure that GAMECENTER is set as the startup project.
Check the Task Manager to see if any unnecessary processes are running that might interfere.


## API Reference


Two of the projects in GAMECENTER work using API services:

Countries Information Project:
This project retrieves detailed information about various countries from an external API, providing data such as population, region, and capital city.

Cryptocurrency Information Project:
This project gathers real-time data on all existing cryptocurrencies using an API service. It provides up-to-date information on prices, market trends, and more.

These projects rely on APIs to keep the information accurate and current.




## Appendix

Any additional information goes here
In addition to the two API-based projects mentioned earlier, the GAMECENTER includes five classic game projects:

Flappy Bird:
The well-known arcade game where the player must navigate a bird through pipes by tapping to keep it airborne.

Pacman:
The nostalgic game in which players control Pacman, navigating mazes while avoiding ghosts and collecting dots.

Space Shooter:
A true childhood classic where players control a spaceship, shooting enemies and dodging obstacles in space.

Blackjack:
The international card game where players try to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Tic-Tac-Toe:
